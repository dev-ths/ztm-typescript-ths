// We use the `arrowSum` function expression that we created earlier:
const ten = calculate(arrowSum, 5, 5);

// We can also use a regular function. Just like a function expression,
// the function signature must match in order to use it.
const twenty = calculate(sum, ten, ten);

// Add more functionality with a function expression to calculate
// the remainder of dividing two numbers:
const remainder = (lhs: number, rhs: number): number => {
  return lhs % rhs;
};

// Use `remainder` as we did `sum`:
const one = calculate(remainder, 4, 3);
